# Structured files

Structured files require some extra information in order for them to be interpreted. These can be binary, or text, and they conform to some structure -- be it proprietary or to some open standard.

## CSV

CSV file functions in Python:
* [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

Each line in a CSV file is a "row" (or record, observation, etc.), and the commas within the file separate the fields (AKA cell, column, or attribute).

CSV files are simple text files, making them convenient and well supported across many different applications. The downside to these files is that they don't contain any extra information such as:
* type of the values seen
* formatting information (color, highlighting, etc.)
* don't have multiple worksheets
* no specified width of the fields

This example uses the `list()` to process the data from `sampleReader` into a list, which has rows and columns:

```python
import csv
with open('sample.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    sampleReader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    sampleData = list(sampleReader)
    print(sampleData)
```
[csv1.py](sample_code/csv1.py)

Now, if your csv file has a header (which our example does), we can view it as follows. This example prints the headers, which are the first row (`sampleData[0]`):

```python
import csv
with open('sample.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    sampleReader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    sampleData = list(sampleReader)
    print(sampleData[0][0:])
```
[csv2.py](sample_code/csv2.py)

We can also load this data into a tuple structure. This example prints the header and data values in the first two columns of the first data row:

```python
import csv
with open('sample.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    sampleReader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    sampleData = tuple(sampleReader)
print(sampleData[0][0], ": ", sampleData[1][0], sep='')
print(sampleData[0][1], ": ", sampleData[1][1], sep='')
```
[csv3.py](sample_code/csv3.py)

Reading data using the `for` loop to process one row at a time. This example prints the row number and the first column of each row:

```python
import csv
csvFile = open('sample.csv')
sampleReader = csv.reader(csvFile)
for row in sampleReader:
    print('Row #' + str(sampleReader.line_num) + ": " + str(row[0]))
csvFile.close()
```
[csv4.py](sample_code/csv4.py)

**Update** You can read the headers row separately from the rest of the CSV file by using `next()` on the csv reader object before reading the data. The following example reads `sample3.csv`, reads the headers row first, and then processes the data rows. This example also shows how you can use `int()` or `float()` to convert the string value to a numeric value so we can use it for math:

```python
import csv
with open('sample3.csv') as csvFile:
    sampleReader = csv.reader(csvFile)
    headers = next(sampleReader)
    total_due = 0
    for row in sampleReader:
        print('Row #' + str(sampleReader.line_num) + ": " + row[3])
        total_due += float(row[3])
    print("Total due: {}".format(total_due))
```
[csv4b.py](sample_code/csv4b.py)

Now, let's look at writing to a CSV file. We open the file for writing, make a `csv.writer()` for it, and then we can write each row (using a list of values):

```python
import csv
csvFile = open('sample2.csv', 'w', newline='')
sampleWriter = csv.writer(csvFile)
sampleWriter.writerow(['Bob', 'Jones', '1234 Elm Street'])
sampleWriter.writerow(['Jill', 'Green', '4321 Pine Avenue'])
csvFile.close()
```
[csv5.py](sample_code/csv5.py)

__NOTE__: In the above code csv5.py, I switched from using the "with open..." form of opening files. I could have written this code as follows:

```python
import csv
with open ('sample2.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvFile:
    sampleWriter = csv.writer(csvFile)
    sampleWriter.writerow(['Bob', 'Jones', '1234 Elm Street'])
    sampleWriter.writerow(['Jill', 'Green', '4321 Pine Avenue'])
```

The output from either would be...

```
$ cat sample2.csv
Bob,Jones,1234 Elm Street
Jill,Green,4321 Pine Avenue
```

If we wanted to edit values, we can read the file into a list `sampleData`, change the contents of the `sampleData` list, open the file again for writing, and write the rows. This example changes `Bob` to `Robert` in the first column of the first row:

```python
import csv
with open('sample2.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    sampleReader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    sampleData = list(sampleReader)

print(sampleData)
sampleData[0][0] = "Robert"

with open ('sample2.csv', 'w') as csvFile:
    sampleWriter = csv.writer(csvFile)
    sampleWriter.writerows(sampleData)

```

## JSON

> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language. (taken from www.json.org)

For more detail on the format of a JSON file, see www.json.org.

In Python, we can use a module `json` to serialize and store our Python objects in a json format file. We can also deserialize and bring these objects back into memory. Json thus serves as a convenient method of storing and sharing persistent data.

For example, let's create a json string (this could simply be a string stored in memory, which is a serialized version of the data structures we are interested in).

```python
import json

somedata = [{'fname': 'Alfred', 'occupation': 'Butler', 'a': (2, 4), 'b': 3.0}]
data_string = json.dumps(somedata)
print('JSON:', data_string)
type(data_string)
```
[json1.py](sample_code/json1.py)

We can then easily store this Json encoded string to a file.

```python
import json
somedata = [{'fname': 'Alfred', 'occupation': 'Butler', 'a': (2, 4), 'b': 3.0}]
with open('data01.json','w') as outfile:
  json.dump(data.outfile)
```
[json2.py](sample_code/json2.py)


```python
import json

somedata = [{'fname': 'Alfred', 'occupation': 'Butler', 'a': (2, 4),
            'b': 3.0, 'c': {'x': 12, 'y': 100}}]

data_string = json.dumps(somedata) # translate this data struct into a json string
print('ENCODED:', data_string) # json encoded (serialized) string representation

decoded = json.loads(data_string) # reverse the process by deserializing the data.
print('DECODED:', decoded)

# now, let's compare the results of the preencoded data, and the end result of the unencoded (deserialized data)
print('ORIGINAL:', type(somedata))
print('DECODED :', type(decoded))
print('ORIGINAL:', type(somedata[0]['fname']))
print('DECODED :', type(decoded[0]['fname']))
print('ORIGINAL:', type(somedata[0]['occupation']))
print('DECODED :', type(decoded[0]['occupation']))
print('ORIGINAL:', type(somedata[0]['a']))
print('DECODED :', type(decoded[0]['a'])) # notice how tuple became a list!
print('ORIGINAL:', type(somedata[0]['b']))
print('DECODED :', type(decoded[0]['b']))
print('ORIGINAL:', type(somedata[0]['c']))
print('DECODED :', type(decoded[0]['c']))

```
[json3.py](sample_code/json3.py)

As we see from the above code, though this shouldn't be much of an issue, remember that tuples become lists when encoded and then decoded.

Here is an example of updating what is stored in a JSON file:  we load, edit, and the store the stored objects - thus simply rewriting the old file.

```python
import json
somedata = {'fname': 'Alfred', 'occupation': 'Butler', 'a': (2, 4),
            'b': 3.0, 'c': {'x': 12, 'y': 100}}
print('ORIGINAL: ', somedata)

f = open('data.json', 'w')
json.dump(somedata, f)
f.close()

f = open('data.json', 'r')
somedata = json.load(f)
f.close()
print('READ FROM JSON FILE: ', somedata)

somedata['fname'] = 'Al'
f = open('data.json', 'w')
json.dump(somedata, f)
f.close()
print('EDITED IN MEMORY: ', somedata)

f = open('data.json', 'w')
json.dump(somedata, f)
f.close()

f = open('data.json', 'r')
somedata = json.load(f)
f.close()
print('RE-READ FROM JSON: ', somedata)

```
[json4.py](sample_code/json4.py)


__NOTE__: Notice that dictionary data types are **unordered**. If you print them, the order may not display in the same order in which the items were created, also, the order could change each time it is printed.

As interesting as JSON is, it's probably not the best approach to storing, and editing, data with any frequency. In such cases, we may want to look at SQLite instead.

## Shelf files

With the `shelve` module, we can save python objects from memory into binary shelf files.

```python
import shelve
shelfie = shelve.open('mydata')
pets = ['Fluffy', 'Pookems', 'Killa']
shelfie['pets'] = pets
shelfie.close()
```
[shelfie1.py](sample_code/shelfie1.py)

```python
import shelve
shelfie = shelve.open('mydata')
print(list(shelfie.keys()))
print(list(shelfie.values()))
shelfie.close()
```
[shelfie2.py](sample_code/shelfie2.py)

...and the output of which looks like:

```
$ python shelfie2.py
['pets']
[['Fluffy', 'Pookems', 'Killa']]
```
__NOTE__: For information on Python object persistence and shelve, read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/shelve.html). Using shelve will not be a requirement for any test or individual assignment in this course... but, it's good to know that it exists, just in case you could use something like this for your final project.
