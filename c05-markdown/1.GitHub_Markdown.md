# Writing notes in Markdown text files

Use Markdown language to take notes about your project (Markdown files end with
the `.md` extension). By default, when viewing your repo on GitHub via the Web,
GitHub will nicely render and display the README.md file found in your
directory. You can click on other Markdown files in your Github repositories and
they will be shown nicely-formatted also.

GitHub markdown is very easy to use. See markdown cheat
sheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
