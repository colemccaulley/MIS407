# Generators

We can create iterables (but to do in our own code, we would need to utilize object oriented programming, which we haven't covered yet). It is much more common to create and use **generators**, or **generator functions**.

Though generators "iterate", Generators have a distinct difference - the values don't need to exist until they are used (you sometimes here Generators called *lazy iteration*). Again: **Values are "generated" based on a generator function only when needed**. This trait comes in handy as we may wish to generate data that would exceed the capacity of our memory.

So, what is the problem solved by a generator?

As with regular functions, often, we wish to use functions to create reusable, logical, and easy-to-understand programs. Let's say we are looking to investigate the next billion square integers, greater than 1 million, to find the number of integers that are multiples of 1024. If we use a function to generate this list, the function will need to create a list of these billion values in memory and then return this huge list back to the program that is looking to process these numbers.

__Warning, before running this code, please realize it will eat your machine because it will use probably 20+GB of you computer memory while processing. Depending on the amount of memory you have, it may take a while to to run. But, that is the point.__

```python
from time import sleep

def sqrList(start=0, count=0):
    data = []
    for i in range(start,start+count):
        data.append(i**2)
    return(data)

data = []
for i in sqrList(10**6, 10**9):
    if i % 1024 == 0:
        data.append(i)
print("There were ", len(data), " instances found. ")
sleep(5)  # sleep 5 seconds, to assist in monitoring memory

```
[gen00a.py](sample_code/gen00a.py)

But, if we use a generator function, or memory usage will be not much more than the space required to store only *one* of these numbers at a time:

```python
from time import sleep

def sqrListGen(start=0, count=0):
    for i in range(start,start+count):
        yield i**2

data = []
for i in sqrListGen(10**6, 10**9):
    if i % 1024 == 0:
        data.append(i)
print("There were ", len(data), " instances found. ")
sleep(5)  # sleep 5 seconds, to assist in monitoring memory

```
[gen00b.py](sample_code/gen00b.py)

On a machine which you have access to memory monitoring, try running the two programs to compare memory usage. The first program will mostly likely consume all your memory, and cause your machine to begin swapping memory to disk (which will result in a program that will be much slower than the second option, which will consume only a trivial amount of memory)

## Generator functions

A python *generator* is basically a special function that returns a generator iterator: an object which we can iterate over in a similar fashion to the iterables we've already covered.

Here is code *without a generator*. Note that the function must return the entire data set, and thus store all of this in memory:

```python
def fun1 (inFileName):
    inFile = open(inFileName)
    firstWords = []
    for line in inFile:
        words = line.split(maxsplit=1)
        if len(words) > 0:
            firstWords.append(words[0])
    inFile.close()
    return(firstWords)

for firstWord in fun1("WizardOfOz.txt"):
    print(firstWord) # note that our function now doesn't need to return the entire list in memory, just one at a time.
```
[gen01.py](sample_code/gen01.py)

In this second example, the function never needs to store more than a lines worth of data in memory, because we use a generator. Note the special keyword `yield`:

```python

def gen_firstWords (inFileName):
    inFile = open(inFileName)
    for line in inFile:
        words = line.split(maxsplit=1)
        if len(words) > 0:
            yield words[0]
    inFile.close()

for firstWord in gen_firstWords("WizardOfOz.txt"):
    print(firstWord) # note that our function now doesn't need to return the entire list in memory, just one at a time.

listOfFirstWords= list(gen_firstWords("WizardOfOz.txt")) # On most computers, you could easily put/and process this all in memory.. once we cast to list, that is what will happen.

```
[gen02.py](sample_code/gen02.py)


There are also times when we may wish to define an *infinite* sequence of values. Yes, this really works! It works because we're stopping after the first 5 values.

```python
def gen_integers(start=0, count=None):
    i = start
    while True:
        yield i
        i = i + 1
        if count!=None:
            if i > start+count:
                return

def gen_squares(start=0, count=None):
    for i in gen_integers(start,count):
        yield i * i

def gen_cubes(start=0, count=None):
    for i in gen_integers(start,count):
        yield i ** 3

def gen_quatrics(start=0, count=None):
    for i in gen_integers(start,count):
        yield i ** 4

for i in gen_integers(10000, 5):
    print(i)

for square in gen_squares(10000, 5):
    print(square)

for cube in gen_cubes(10000, 5):
    print(cube)

for quatric in gen_quatrics(10000, 5):
    print(quatric)
```
[gen03.py](sample_code/gen03.py)

Output...

```
$ python gen03.py
10000
10001
10002
10003
10004
10005

Or, we could create a investment growth table generator. Because of the generator, the investment can be simulated for as long as we like. We'll stop counting after 10 values.

```python
def gen_integers(start=0, count=None):
    i = start
    while True:
        yield i
        i = i + 1
        if count!=None:
            if i > start+count:
                return

def fv_table(PV, r, start=0, count=30):
    for i in gen_integers(start,count):
        FV = PV*(1+r)**i
        yield FV


for balance in fv_table(100000, .07, start=0, count=10):
    print('${:,.2f}'.format(balance))
```
[gen04.py](sample_code/gen04.py)

```
$ python gen04.py
$100,000.00
$107,000.00
$114,490.00
$122,504.30
$131,079.60
$140,255.17
$150,073.04
$160,578.15
$171,818.62
$183,845.92
$196,715.14
```

We can also use this technique to search large files, such as in the case of analyze a huge Apache (web server) log file, to determine the total number of bytes transferred.

```python
def logBytes(inFileName):
    line_num = 0
    inFile = open(inFileName)
    for line in inFile:
        line_num+=1
        x = line.rsplit(None,1)[1]
        if x!='-':
            yield int(x)
    inFile.close()


for x in logBytes("access_log"):
    print("Byte={:,}".format(x) ) # note that our function now doesn't need to return the entire list in memory, just one at a time.

print('The total bytes transferred = {:,}'.format(sum(logBytes("access_log"))))
```
[gen05.py](sample_code/gen05.py)

Finally, we can combine list comprehensions and generators to create generator comprehensions by using the generator in the list comprehension:

```python
log = open("access_log")
# Create a list containing the column where the bytes transferred should be
bytecolumn = (line.rsplit(None,1)[1] for line in log)
# Filter the bytecolumn into a list: only select numeric values, and convert to int
bytes = (int(x) for x in bytecolumn if x != '-')
# Finally, sum the list of bytes and print:
print('The total bytes transferred = {:,}'.format(sum(bytes)))
log.close()
```
[gen06.py](sample_code/gen06.py)

```
The total bytes transferred = 10,943,424
```
## A couple other useful data structures

### namedtuples

First, a normal tuple:

```python
tim = ('Tim','Smith', '123 Wayward Way')
print(tim[0])
print(tim[1])
print(tim[2])
```
[adt02a.py](sample_code/adt02a.py)

```
$ python adt02a.py
Tim
Smith
123 Wayward Way
```

Now, create types with named values. First, define the members in the namedtuple, and then create namedtuples with values specified for each of the members. Then, we can access the members by name:

```python
from collections import namedtuple
person = namedtuple('Person', ['first', 'last', 'address'])
tim = person('Tim','Smith', '123 Wayward Way')
print(tim.first)
print(tim.last)
print(tim.address)
jane = person('Jane', 'Smith', '21 Elm St.')
print(jane.first)
print(jane.last)
print(jane.address)
for p in [tim,jane]:
    print('%s %s lives at %s' % p)
```
[adt02b.py](sample_code/adt02b.py)

```
$ python adt02b.py
Tim
Smith
123 Wayward Way
Jane
Smith
21 Elm St.
Tim Smith lives at 123 Wayward Way
Jane Smith lives at 21 Elm St.

```

## Sets

Sets are useful when we want to eliminate duplicates (so each value is unique). Lists are good for *order*, sets are good for *membership*.

As we should have noticed, lists allow for duplicates:

```
names =['Tim', 'Sue', 'Tim', 'Betty']
print(names)
```
[sets01.py](sample_code/sets01.py)

```
$ python sets01.py
['Tim', 'Sue', 'Tim', 'Betty']
```

But, sets eliminate duplicates:
```
names ={'Tim', 'Sue', 'Tim', 'Betty'}
print(names)
```
[sets02.py](sample_code/sets02.py)

```
$ python sets02.py
{'Tim', 'Betty', 'Sue'}
```

For more on sets, see here...

## Counters

```python
from collections import Counter

c = Counter('zyzzy')

print(c)
c['a']+=2
print(c)
c['z']+=2
print(c)
```
[counter01.py](counter01.py)

```
$ python counter01.py
Counter({'z': 3, 'y': 2})
Counter({'z': 3, 'y': 2, 'a': 2})
Counter({'z': 5, 'y': 2, 'a': 2})
```
