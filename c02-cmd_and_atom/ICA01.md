## Bash Basics

In this assignment, I will guide you step-by-step through this process.

1. Open a bash terminal in a personal directory (wherever you will be keeping your MIS407 materials - probably your T: drive):
   * Open the File Explorer in Windows
   * Click `This PC` on the left side
   * Right-click on the drive
   * Select `Git Bash Shell Here` from the drop-down menu.
   If `Git Bash Shell Here` doesn't appear in the drop-down menu, go to the Windows Start menu, enter `bash`, and select `Git Bash`, then enter `cd /t` to switch to your T: drive.

 Keep this bash terminal open for the entire session. Once complete, you will cut and paste the text from this session and store in in a file called `ICA01.txt`. You will then submit this file to Canvas.

1. Enter the command to display the current working directory
1. Enter the command to create a new directory called `test_folder`
1. List all contents in the current directory
1. Enter the command to change directory into your new directory `test_folder`
1. Using the `echo` command, create a file called `test.py` that contains the python command `print('Hello my name is Slim Shady')` (**be sure to insert your real name instead of Slim Shady**).
1. Enter the command to display the contents of the `test.py` to the console.
1. Use python to run the `test.py` program
1. Enter the command to copy the file `test.py` file to `test.py.BAK` in the directory above your current directory.
1. Enter the command to delete the `test.py` file.
1. Enter the command to move up one directory (back into your original directory)
1. Enter the command to display the current working directory
1. Enter the command to remove the `test_folder` directory.
1. Enter the command to list the contents of the current directory to verify that you deleted the folder.
