# Introduction to Closures

When we create simple functions, each time we call the function it does exactly the same thing.
We've seen a couple of examples of nested functions but haven't talked yet about the extraordinary power: we can "program" the creation of different functions based on **run time conditions**. For example, the following code generates a function based on the parameters you give it. Think about it as "meta programming": **you're using Python to generate code based on the logic you provide** .

```python
def f(x):
    def g():
        print(x)
    return(g)

fnc1 = f(2)
fnc2 = f(100)

fnc1()
fnc2()
```
[close01.py](close01.py)

The output of which is:
```
$ python close01.py
2
100
```

Now, here's where some of the really interesting opportunities of this concept come to fruition. In this case, we can create a function that generates power functions of any degree that we'd like:

```python
def f(x):
    def g(y):
        return(y**x)
    return(g)
sqr = f(2)
print(sqr(3))
sqrt = f(1/2)
print(sqrt(9))
cube = f(3)
print(cube(3))
cubert = f(1/3)
print(cubert(27))
```

This produces the following output.

```
$ python nested_functions3.py
9
3.0
27
3.0
```
> __SIDEBAR__: The last two examples illustrate a specific type of nested function called a "closure". We will cover this concept (and the related concept of decorators) next week when we discuss functions in greater detail
