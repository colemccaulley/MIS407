# Function Decorators

Function decorators are simply wrappers around existing functions - they are "syntactic sugar" that allow us to utilize properties of closures to "wrap" an existing function with logic that is run before and after an the existing function is called. This wrapping adds the functionality of the function in some way. This is ideal when you need to extend the functionality of functions, but also wish to keep these functions unchanged.

Let's say we have a function that prints text to the command line. We have no reason to change this function, it works fine, but we'd like it to output as HTML for a webpage.

using closures...

```python
def print_x(x):
    return(x**2)

def html_decorate(func):
    def wrapper(x):
        return("<html><header></header><body><p>{0}</p></body></html>".format(func(x)))
    return wrapper

print_x_html = html_decorate(print_x)
print(print_x_html(10))
```
(see [dec01.py](dec01.py))


..."doing the same thing" but now using the "decorator" syntax...

```python

def html_decorate(func):
    def wrapper(x):
        return("<html><header></header><body><p>{0}</p></body></html>".format(func(x)))
    return wrapper

@html_decorate
def print_x(x):
    return(x**2)

print(print_x(10))
```
[dec02.py](dec02.py)


Here are some more useful/practical examples:

The following decorator will slow down the execution of the function by sleeping for 1 second before it's called.

```python
from time import sleep
import sys

def slow_your_roll(function):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        sleep(1)
        function(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@slow_your_roll
def some_function(x):
    print("# -> "+str(x))

@slow_your_roll
def some_other_function(x,y):
    print("# -> "+str(x) + " -- ", str(y))

for i in range(3):
    some_function(i)

for i in range(3):
    some_other_function(i, i*2)

```

__note__: you may want to run python without buffering. You do this bay calling the module with the command `python -u dec04.py`. Try running the scripts buffered and unbuffered to see the difference.

We'll use decorators much more when we begin our work with web development and flask.
