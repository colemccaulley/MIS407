# Python Strings

Strings are simply data structures that hold a sequence of characters.

Strings are a immutable type in Python (more about mutable and immutable later)

We create a string, like any variable in Python, by simply assigning it:

```
s = "Hello World"
```

And we can *slice* a string anyway we'd like, using brackets to indicate slicing. You can use one or two colons between numbers to slice starting at an index, ending at an index, and how many characters to advance:

[ *start* : *end* : *stride* ]

* *start* index of the character to start the slice (default: 0)
* *end* index of the character to stop the slice (default: end of string)
* *stride* how many characters to advance (default: 1)

```
print(s[:2])    # Prints first two chars "He"
print(s[3:])    # Prints chars starting at index 3: "lo World"
print(s[2:5])   # Prints chars at index 3 to 5: "lo"
print(s[2:7:2]) # Prints every other char at index 2 to 7: "loW"
```

Note that you can use negative numbers in the slice to get the end of the string, like this to get the last character in the string:
```
print(s[-1:])
```

We can find a string's length:

```
len(s)
```

And, we have a number of other useful functions:

```
s.count("e")
s.find("H")
s.index("World")
```

For instance, we could count the number of "e"'s or the number of spaces:

```
s.count("e")
s.count(" ")
```

We may also want to split up a string based on the spaces found:
```
s.split(' ')
```

We can also replace strings found within the string:

```
s.replace("Hello", "Goodbye cruel")
```

And, there a number of other useful supporting functions:
```
s.upper()
s.lower()
s.title()
s.capitalize()
s.swapcase()
```

And, we can strip off leading and trailing characters (which space)

```
s = "     Hello World      \n"
s.strip()
s.lstrip()
s.rstrip()
```

As we expect, we concatenate as well
```
s = "Hello " + "World"
s = "Hello " + "World" + "!"
```

Handy methods to determine the type of a character (letter, digit, etc):

```
s = "Hello World"

s[0].isalnum()
s[0].isalpha()
s[0].isdigit()
s[0].istitle()
s[0].isupper()
s[0].islower()
s[0].isspace()
s.endswith('d')
s.startswith('H')
```

# An illustrative Example: Control flow and string slicing

The following program scrambles a person's first name by replacing all vowels with a random vowel.

Also, notice how this also preserves the case of any given character.

[vowels.py](./sample_code/vowels.py)
```python
import random

lvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
uvowels =  ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
vowels =  lvowels + uvowels

fname = input("Enter your first name: ")

new_name = ""
for i in range(len(fname)):
  if fname[i] not in vowels:
      new_name += fname[i]
  else:
      if fname[i].isupper():
          new_name += random.choice(uvowels)
      else:
          new_name += random.choice(lvowels)

print(new_name)
```
