# Deploying our web site in the Heroku cloud

## PaaS (Platform as a Service) and Flask

We'll be using Heroku as our PaaS (Platform as a Service). Heroku supports many development languages and environments. In our case, we will be using Python and creating a Web Interface to our application.

## Deploying website into the "cloud"

With our experience with the command line and git, deploying on Heroku is relatively easy. Cloud based services also allow us to focus on app functionality and programming instead of server/infrastructure issues.

I've broken the deployment process down to 8 steps.

### Step 1 - Set up Virtual environment

First, we need to set up a virtual environment (and it's a good practice is to have a "clean" installation of python, specific to our application).

This isn't a virtual machine, but rather a **virtual python environment**. This simply allows us to create a set of python libraries specifically for our project. Up until this point, when we do a `pip install` we've been installing our libraries in one central library for all our python projects.

There are times though where we may want to create an isolated set of libraries specific to our project for deployment testing. For our Heroku deployment, we need to isolate and identify the specified dependencies of our python program so we can easily create a list of the required packages. Heroku needs this list of dependencies to start our service.

Here's how we create a virtual environment:

1. We need to install the virtual environment module `virtualenv`:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

1. Now use it to create a new python virtual environment in the subdirectory named `virtual`:

```
python -m venv virtual
```

1. Install any libraries needed for our web server program:

   * Install `flask`:
```
$ virtual/bin/pip install flask
```

   * Install `requests` (which we use for the weather page):
```
$ virtual/bin/pip install requests
```

   * Install `markdown` (which we use to show the `README` page):
```
$ virtual/bin/pip install markdown
```

   * Run our web service to make sure it's working in our virtual environment.
```
$ virtual/bin/python websiteCode/mis407_wap.py
```

### Step 2: Create an account in Heroku

http://www.heroku.com

Once you have an account, you can log in an see my "dashboard"

We will create our app using the command line.

### Step 3: Download the heroku toolbelt.

Heroku provides a command line utility to help us manage our website.

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line

NOTE: The heroku toolbelt should already be installed on Gerdin 1117 lab computers.

### Step 4: Once installed, "login" .

```
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: <your email that you used to sign up>
Password (typing will be hidden):
Logged in as <your email>
```

### Step 5: Create an app (a place to receive our code on the website)

Heroku uses a name we give to the service -- it's a global name, so you'll need to choose a name different than the examples shown below. The examples use `mis407-demo`, which is leftover from previous semesters. If you want to deploy the app, you'll need to use a different, unique name -- such as adding your initials to the name to make it unique.

```
$ heroku create mis407f18-demo
Creating mis407f18-demo... done
https://mis407f18-demo.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/mis407f18-demo.git
```

NOTE: To see a list of your current apps:

```
$ heroku apps
=== ghelmer@iastate.edu Apps
mis407f18-demo
```

Now, we can go to our dashboard, and see that we have a new app.

### Step 6: Create 3 files that will be needed by Heroku

First, I need to install `gunicorn` into the virtual environment (Heroku needs this to run our webserver - it's a module that manages our web service):

```
$virtual\Scripts\pip install gunicorn
```

Then, before we push our app to Heroku we need three files: `requirements.txt`, `runtime.txt`, and `Procfile`.

#### Step 6a: Create a requirements.txt

We'll build our `requirements.txt` file automatically by getting a list of packages installed in our virtual environment. This file contains a list of dependencies we want Heroku to use in the remote environment -- this is how we tell Heroku what packages our web service needs:

```
$ virtual/bin/pip freeze
certifi==2018.10.15
chardet==3.0.4
Click==7.0
Flask==1.0.2
gunicorn==19.9.0
idna==2.7
itsdangerous==1.1.0
Jinja2==2.10
Markdown==3.0.1
MarkupSafe==1.1.0
requests==2.20.0
urllib3==1.24.1
Werkzeug==0.14.1
```

Cut and paste this list into a new file `requirements.txt`.

#### Step 6b: Create a Procfile

Just use Atom to create a file called `websiteCode/Procfile` (note: there is not extension)

In this file we type:

```
web: gunicorn mis407_wap:app
```

This file tells Heroku we have a `gunicorn` application whose main file is `mis407_wap` and whose web application object (flask app) is called `app` (note: this must be the same name as the variable we instantiated the Flask object in our main module).

#### Step 6c: Create a runtime.txt

The file `websiteCode/runtime.txt` tells Heroku which python to use to run our code. The MIS computers currently have python 3.6.5 on them, so we'll use that.

```
python-3.6.5
```

### Step 7: Deploy using Git

To load our application into Heroku, we create a new git repo, and use the heroku toolbelt to add heroku to the repo's remote git servers:

```
$ cd websiteCode
$ git init
$ heroku git:remote -a mis40718-demo
$ git remote -v
```

Now, we can work with/manage our Heroku app like it was a GitHub repo. The `git push` command below pushes our current branch to the heroku git server's master branch:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "Initial push MIS407 app"
$ git push heroku master
```

(see: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/mis407f18-demo/deploy/heroku-git)

After you've done this, you should be able to go to your console and see that the app has been successfully deployed and built.

### Step 8: Test

Now, go to your new site and check that everything is working OK.

If you have trouble with the above, there are plenty of tutorials out there. Take a look at Heroku.com (or use google).
